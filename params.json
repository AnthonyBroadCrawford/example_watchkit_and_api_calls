{"name":"Example Watchkit App w/ background API calls","tagline":"A simple project illustrating how to have your watchkit extension (both Glance and App) interface with your iOS app to make a sucessful http api call to retrieve remote data","body":"### Why I created this example\r\nI recently had to build a WatchKit app that connected to the parent app to retrieve data.  What made this a bit tricky, is that the parent app would need to call a remote http api to obtain the necessary data.  \r\n\r\nOddly enough, the necessary steps are not well documented and a lot of the information I found online was incomplete.\r\n\r\n### What this example includes \r\nThis example covers the following use-cases \r\n\r\n- Glance interface requesting remote data from iOS parent\r\n- Watch app requesting remote data from iOS parent \r\n- AppDelegate handleWatchKitExtensionRequest properly orchestrating a remote http api call\r\n\r\nI've additionally thrown in some XCTTests' for the code in the project.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
